The Tango-Controls device server for Chronologic xTDC4. Windows 64-bit only.

For information on the device see https://www.cronologic.de/time_measurement/tdc/xtdc4/

The device server implements a (partial) wrapper around proprietary driver xtdc4_driver_64.dll, 
	enhanced with regular readout of DMA memory and re-parsing of weird output data structures into four separate channels.
Histogramming might be added in the future.
	
Quickstart sequence:

1)Init
2)Edit attributes
3)Start
4)Periodically read the channel spectrum attributes for timestamps. The read timestamps are released from memory.
5)Stop

Call Off to release xTDC4 for offline use. Call Init to acquire again.
